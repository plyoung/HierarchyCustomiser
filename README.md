# Hierarchy Customiser

This tool allows you to add associate icons, text colour and background colour with Tags and Layers. These options are then applied to entries in the Hierarchy panel.

- Open the customiser settings via `Window > Hierarchy Customiser`.
- There are options for tags below the layer options (note you can collapse the layer group).
- **Ico** is the icon to use.
- **L** is whether the icon should be shown to the Left or Right.
- **Offs** is the offset of icon from edge of panel.
- **Text** is text colour. An alpha of 0 means it should not be used so be sure to increase the alpha if you use this option.
- **Back** is the background colour. Alpha = 0 means this is not used.
